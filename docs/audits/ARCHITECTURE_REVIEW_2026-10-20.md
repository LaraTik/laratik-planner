# Architecture review — 2026-10-20

## Review status

Initial repository-wide architecture review. This is a prioritized work queue,
not a claim that every route or behavior has already received a manual review.
The working tree contained pre-existing edits across product code, tests,
message catalogs, and `AGENTS.md` at review start. Those edits are part of the
baseline and were not treated as authored by this review.

## Repository shape observed

- Next.js App Router with TypeScript, Drizzle/Postgres, NextAuth, shared React
  UI, and a separate Python Trends service.
- At review start, the source prompt specified feature modules, but the source
  was primarily organized into 437 files under `src/app`, 227 component files,
  and 517 library files. There was no `src/features/` tree yet.
- Static App Router inventory at review start: 91 `page.tsx` files, 105
  `route.ts` handlers, 42 `loading.tsx` surfaces, and 9 `error.tsx` surfaces.
  The number of route files alone does not prove state or test coverage; page
  review remains grouped by feature and route contract.
- Existing quality controls include strict TypeScript, Next ESLint defaults,
  Vitest domain and component tests with coverage floors, integration and
  migration drills, Playwright browser/a11y/visual suites, `pnpm verify`, and
  CodeGraph. Prefer these before adding another tool.
- Existing architecture rules already cover tenant scoping, workflow
  ownership, transactions, the app-shell query budget, localization, and
  migration safety. Refinement must extend these contracts rather than replace
  them.

## Ownership and dependency map

| Surface                     | Current ownership                                                       | Review notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

App Router files mix public/auth screens, agency settings, platform administration, workspace routes, APIs, and cron adapters. Workspace routes use the agency-qualified route shape; the legacy workspace path remains a compatibility adapter. |
| Shared UI                   | `src/components`                                                        | `ui/` owns primitives; `forms/` owns shared controls; `feedback/` and `app-shell/` own cross-feature presentation. Feature decisions remain close to their current route/domain until a bounded migration moves them.                                                             |
| Domain behavior             | `src/lib/<domain>`                                                      | Domains include auth, AI, advertising, brand, community, content, deliveries, notifications, planning, publishing, research, social, storage, tasks, Trends, and workspace access. This is the existing migration source for gradual feature modules.                             |
| Feature modules             | `src/features/<feature>`                                                | The Trends catalog is the first pilot. It owns source metadata and exports through `index.ts`; routes and services import its public entry point.                                                                                                                                 |
| Persistence                 | `src/lib/db`                                                            | Drizzle schema and ordered SQL migrations own persistence. The current migration journal has 90 entries; schema or identifier changes require the migration evidence protocol.                                                                                                    |

The Next.js catalog is a UI projection; parity tests cover shared policy fields.                                                                                                                               |
| External integrations       | `src/lib/{social,advertising,ai,email,mcp}` and route adapters          | Provider-specific boundaries remain isolated from UI; cron and callbacks are transport adapters.

Changes here require operational and rollback evidence.                                                                                                                          |
| Tests                       | `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e`                          | 547 unit test files, 44 integration files, and 349 E2E files/assets at inventory time. Vitest covers rules/components; Postgres tests cover persistence; Playwright covers user journeys, accessibility, and visual output.                                                       |

The dependency direction is route/UI → feature public API → platform/domain
infrastructure → persistence/provider adapters. Existing `src/lib` modules
remain valid during migration; features must not import route files or another
feature's internals.

## Prioritized findings

### A1 — Feature ownership is not yet visible in the source layout

**Priority: P1 — maintainability and change risk.** The master prompt's
feature-module rule has not been adopted in the source tree. Product UI is
spread across route-local files and shared component folders, while domain
logic lives under `src/lib/<domain>/`. This makes it harder to identify a
feature's full change and test surface. **First pilot completed:** the Trends
source catalog now lives in `src/features/trends/`, exposes a public
`index.ts`, and has nine production/test callers migrated. The old `src/lib`
copy was removed, so the feature has one canonical catalog. The migration
preserved route/API contracts and passed the full `pnpm verify` run. Continue
with one bounded feature at a time; this does not imply a repo-wide move.

### A2 — Trends source policy had drifted and review-required sources could be enabled

**Priority: P1 — operator safety and provider-policy correctness.** The
TypeScript UI projection disagreed with the Python scheduler catalog on shared
policy fields: tier, cadence, ToS class, and API-key requirement. For example,
the UI had classified some zero-cost sources as paid, omitted keys required by
some extractors, and marked review-required provider sources as clean. The
single-source and onboarding bulk-enable routes also had no server-side gate
for `review_required`, so the UI's metadata could not have protected direct
requests.

**Addressed in this milestone.** Shared policy fields now follow the Python
source of truth. `tests/unit/trends/source-catalog-parity.test.ts` checks the
shared keys, tier, cadence, key requirement, and ToS class. UI-only display
labels and platform grouping remain explicit projections. Both enable routes
now reject review-required sources; the two UIs explain the requirement in
English and Arabic, and existing enabled rows can still be disabled. No source
keys, DB rows, or provider responses were changed. A source may become
enableable by changing its catalog review status after the required external
review is complete.

### A3 — Repeated form behavior is only partly centralized

**Priority: P2 — consistency.** Brand Kit forms already use shared `FormField`,
`FormSubmitButton`, and `useSuccessReset`, but at least two forms still repeat
the same control class, action-state shape, and alert markup. Their field
semantics differ, so first review the whole form family and extract only
shared interaction/presentation behavior. Several of these files were already
modified in the starting working tree; defer edits until those changes are
stable and coordinate against their current diff.

### A4 — Scheduled route wrappers repeat transport scaffolding

**Priority: P2 — consistency and testability.** Six cron routes share
authorization and response-header behavior; several also repeat timing,
unauthorized-response, and GET/POST delegation code. Their business work,
failure response shapes, and side effects differ, so a broad generic runner
could hide meaningful behavior. Add route-level coverage first, then extract
only a narrow common contract if it removes real caller complexity.

### A5 — Several modules warrant responsibility review

**Priority: P2 — audit queue, not a defect finding.** Initial size inventory
flags `src/lib/mcp/server.ts`, `src/lib/media/service.ts`,
`src/lib/content/service.ts`, Meta provider handling, the planning detail and
publish pages, and advertising/engagement surfaces. Large modules are only
review targets: split them only when responsibilities, change reasons, or
test seams are demonstrably mixed.

### A6 — Historical audit findings need status reconciliation

**Priority: P1 — correctness of the backlog.** The repository retains older
review documents with security and feature findings. A spot reconciliation
against `FULL_REVIEW_2026-08-25.md` confirms that its P0 list cannot be copied
forward unchanged: `OTHER-01`'s Meta selection flow now queries by the selected
platforms and links profiles in a transaction; `OTHER-02`'s role helper now
uses a request-cached role set; the outbox dispatcher now handles the event
kinds the old audit called missing, and `/api/cron/outbox` is present. These
findings are no longer current as written. The old `TEST-01` claim is stale:
`tests/integration/journey.test.ts` now maps §23 steps 1–30 to assertions,
including the delivery/review/publish lifecycle. The old `TEST-04` claim is
also stale: `tests/integration/bootstrap-concurrency.test.ts` races five real
Postgres transactions and asserts exactly one admin wins, plus sequential and
invalid-token cases. Both suites passed in the current integration run.
The focused reconciliation does not certify the rest of the historical
findings: review `TEST-02`, `TEST-03`, `FEAT-01`, `FEAT-02`, and the remaining
security and feature findings against current code before closing them. Keep
only gaps that reproduce and record their current evidence and owner/acceptance
test.

### A7 — Shared page header emitted invalid markup for rich descriptions

**Priority: P1 — hydration and cross-browser correctness.** The media page
passes `MediaBreadcrumb` (a `<nav>`) through `PageHeader.description`, whose
implementation wrapped arbitrary `ReactNode` content in a `<p>`. The browser
reported invalid nested markup and a potential hydration error during the
release browser run. The wrapper is now a neutral `<div>` that matches the
existing rich-content prop contract. A component regression test rejects the
invalid nesting, and the media accessibility route test asserts the
breadcrumb renders without the hydration warning.

### A8 — Brand Kit mutations did not refresh server-rendered lists

**Priority: P1 — user-visible stale state.** Brand Kit server actions mutated
assets, rules, and resources, but the page's server-rendered lists were not
revalidated. A successful create could return success while the newly saved
record remained absent until a manual reload. The actions now invalidate the
workspace Brand Kit index and affected section after successful create,
archive, restore, and template operations. The administration browser journey
covers the create/archive/list behavior and cross-workspace scoping.

### A9 — Agency switching raced cookie and client navigation

**Priority: P1 — tenant-context consistency.** The agency switch POST commits
the signed agency cookie, while the component immediately issued a client
route push and refresh. Browser evidence showed the old route could remain
active after the successful response, leaving the shell and URL out of sync
with the selected agency. The switch now performs a full document navigation
to the server-provided destination after the POST completes. E2E coverage
asserts the successful switch response, canonical agency-qualified URL, and
updated shell context.

### A10 — Playwright could begin before the cold Auth.js route was ready

**Priority: P2 — test reliability.** The dev server readiness endpoint could
respond before the first `/api/auth/session` request had a usable App Router
manifest. On a cold server this produced a transient 500 and left some browser
journeys on a loading boundary. Playwright global setup now retries the
session endpoint until it returns JSON or times out, before any browser test
starts. The release run must verify this handshake in the supported test
environment.

### A11 — Successful workflow mutations left server-rendered views stale

**Priority: P1 — workflow correctness and user confidence.** Browser evidence
showed that assigning a designer advanced the server workflow but left the
workflow rail at its previous state; submitting a delivery closed the form
without updating delivery history or status; and recording a publication
outcome left the channel card at `ready_to_publish`. The successful client
paths now call `router.refresh()` after assignment, claim, delivery submit,
and publication outcome saves. The workflow assignment has a focused unit
regression, and the §23 Playwright journey verifies the full progression to
published. The planning-stage filter test also now checks its returned status
contract without assuming a pristine shared workspace database.

### A12 — Theme shell test seeded one workspace and opened another

**Priority: P2 — browser-suite reliability.** The account-theme shell test
seeded a workspace named `shell-theme` but navigated to the legacy `/app/w/acme`
route, so it rendered the unavailable-workspace boundary before testing the
theme menu. The test now opens the seeded workspace through its canonical
agency-qualified route. The corrected test passes in Chromium; Firefox could
not start the first test in this environment and remained at full CPU without
emitting a result, so the remaining browser matrix is still unverified.

## Next work, ordered

1. Complete the route, domain, database, integration, and test coverage map;
   inspect all high-risk historical findings and their regression evidence
   against current code. Do not treat the 2026-08-25 P0 count as current.
2. Establish the module rules in
   [`../architecture/module-ownership.md`](../architecture/module-ownership.md)
   and align contributor guidance with that target.
3. Select the next low-risk feature slice after the Trends catalog pilot.
4. Tackle confirmed security, tenant, workflow, transaction, privacy, provider,
   or shared-rendering bugs as isolated regression-tested changes.
5. Review pages and shared UI in route groups, recording bilingual, responsive,
   keyboard, accessibility, loading/empty/error, and visual evidence.

## Evidence and limits

CodeGraph was used for module and call-path discovery. The Trends policy gate
was changed without changing source keys, persisted data, or provider response
contracts. The initial baseline passed `pnpm verify`, all 44 integration
files, and the five-scenario migration drill. Targeted Trends, PageHeader,
Brand Kit, agency-switcher, content-flow, and account-theme checks passed in
Chromium, including the full §23 journey. The release browser run passed its
first 52 Chromium cases except for the A12 stale route in the theme shell test;
that fixture path is corrected. The isolated Firefox rerun then hung before
the first test result with its browser process at full CPU. Full five-browser
and visual gates and exact-clean-commit evidence remain outstanding.

The original working tree contained user changes, captured as the review
baseline; implementation work is isolated on `codex/architecture-review`.
The route, domain, database, integration, and historical-finding inventory
remains an active audit queue. This first pass does not claim that every route
has received manual review or that independent `Verified` status has been
assigned.
